				<h1>Perfect Maze Generator</h1>
				<span class="image main"><img src="../images/PMG.png" alt="" /></span>
				<h2>Context</h2>
				<p>
					In my search for an intership I e-mailed many companies. One of these companies wanted
					me to complete a test before I could come for the interview. The assignment was to create
					a perfect maze generator using any algorithm I wanted. A perfect maze is defined as having
					no loops and no inaccessible areas. Any two points are connected by a singular unbroken path.
				</p>
				<h2>Execution</h2>
				<p>
					I finished this project in about a week and included 3 algorithms the user can choose from.
					I also added a lot of other customization like maze colors, size and generation speed. A
					problem I encountered when making this is that the performance really isn't great. I had to
					limit the maze size to 50x50 because things really started to slow down after that. I think
					the main reason for this is that all the maze cells and walls are individual UI objects. If
					I remember correctly the whole canvas is redrawn every time a single element under that canvas
					changes. With 50x50 maze that will be 12,500 elements, however I never made a GameObject version
					so this is all just speculation.
				</p>
				<h2>Updates</h2>
				<p>
					In the first semester of the 2019-2020 schoolyear I learned about the SOLID principles. An
					assignment we had was to choose any project and improve the code by applying the SOLID principles.
					For this assingment I chose this project because there was quite a lot of improvement I could make.
					These improvements came from the feedback I got at the interview with the company and also from
					learning about the SOLID principles. You can compare these changes by looking at the project before
					the changes I made on <a
